# Diamond Price Prediction Web APP

This project is a Diamond Price Prediction Web Application developed using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a machine learning model integrated to predict diamond prices based on various attributes. The app allows users to enter details such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions, then utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to provide an estimated price. The model is trained on a comprehensive diamond dataset, leveraging attributes that impact diamond valuation. This tool aims to help users gain insights into the diamond market and make informed purchasing or valuation decisions.

The app features a responsive front end, crafted with a user-friendly interface, including a prediction form, error handling, and a stylish design. The project showcases the seamless integration of machine learning in web applications, utilizing Flask APIs to serve predictions.
